  'And as we wind on down the road ' +
  'our shadows taller than our soul ' +
  'there walks a lady we all know ' +
  'who shines white light and wants to show ' +
  'how everything still turns to gold. ' +
  'and if you listen very hard ' +
  'the tune will come to you at last ' +
  'when all are one and one is all ' +
  'to be a rock and not to roll.',
  
  'Are you lonesome tonight? ' +
  'Do you miss me tonight? ' +
  'Are you sorry we drifted apart? ' +
  'Does your memory stray to a bright sunny day? ' +
  'When I kissed you and called you sweetheart? ' +
  'Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare? ' +
  'Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there? ' +
  'Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again? ' +
  'Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?',
  
  'Fly away, to the rainbow in the sky. ' +
  'Gold is at the end for each of us to find. ' +
  'There the road begins, where another one will end. ' +
  'Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend. ' +
  'All to be the Master of the Wind.', 
  
  'He goes along just as a water lily. ' +
  'Gentle on the surface of his thoughts his body floats. ' +
  'Unweighed down by passion or intensity. ' +
  'Yet unaware of the depth upon which he coasts. ' +
  'And he finds a home in me. ' +
  'For what misfortune sows, he knows my touch will reap.',
  
  'I don\'t believe in destiny or the guiding hand of fate. ' +
  'I don\'t believe in forever, or love as a mystical state. ' +
  'I don\'t believe in the stars or the planets ' +
  'or angels watching from above. ' +
  'But I believe there\'s a ghost of a chance ' +
  'we can find someone to love ' +
  'and make it last.',
  
  'While you were sleeping, you tossed, you turned. ' +
  'You rolled your eyes as the world burned. ' +
  'The heavens fell, the earth quaked. I thought ' +
  'you must be, but you weren\'t awake.',
  
  'I met a girl who sang the blues ' +
  'and I asked her for some happy news, ' +
  'but she just smiled and turned away. ' +
  'And the three men I admire most, ' +
  'The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost, ' +
  'They caught the last train to the coast' +
  'The day the music died.',
  
  'But of all these friends and lovers, ' +
  'there is no one that compares with you. ' +
  'And these memories lose their meaning ' +
  'when I think of love as something new. ' +
  'Though I know I\'ll never lose affection ' +
  'for people and things that went before ' +
  'I know I\'ll often stop and think about them ' +
  'in my life, I love you more.',
  
  'Down the street the dogs are barking. ' +
  'And the day is getting dark. ' +
  'As the night comes in a-falling, ' +
  'the dogs\'ll lose their bark ' +
  'and the silent night will shatter. ' +
  'From the sounds inside my mind, ' +
  'for I\'m one to many mornings ' +
  'and a thousand miles behind. ' +
  'From the crossroads of my doorstep, ' +
  'my eyes they start to fade, ' +
  'as I turn my head back to the room ' +
  'where my love and I have laid.'
